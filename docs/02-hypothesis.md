"When models encounter systematically ambiguous or conflicting training signals that they cannot disambiguate, they encode these conflicts in superposition within their existing representational structures. This creates persistent interference that propagates beyond the immediate domain of conflict, particularly when the conflicts align with fundamental features the model uses for broader reasoning."
