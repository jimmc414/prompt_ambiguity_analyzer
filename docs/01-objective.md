# Objective Statement for Pre-Inference Prompt Ambiguity Detection Meta-Prompt

[← Back to README](../README.md) | [Next: Hypothesis →](02-hypothesis.md)

## Purpose
Develop a comprehensive meta-prompt that analyzes and classifies ambiguous, conflicting, or problematic instruction patterns in user prompts before submission to frontier language models, based on empirical evidence that such patterns cause systematic output corruption through superposition interference and emergent misalignment.

## Core Objective
Create a prompt-based analysis tool that identifies prompt characteristics known to trigger:
- **Superposition interference**: When models attempt to encode conflicting instructions in overlapping representational space, producing compromised outputs that partially violate multiple constraints
- **Emergent misalignment**: When localized ambiguities corrupt broader model behavior beyond the immediate domain of conflict
- **Gradient confusion**: When contradictory signals prevent clean resolution, resulting in averaged/interpolated responses rather than coherent outputs

## Technical Foundation
This meta-prompt leverages findings from mechanistic interpretability research demonstrating that:
1. Neural networks cannot discard conflicting information but must encode all signals in superposition
2. Models lack mechanisms to recognize or signal internal conflicts, producing confident-appearing but multiply non-compliant outputs
3. Certain patterns of ambiguity (intention unclear, domain mixing, constraint conflicts) are particularly destructive
4. Task context and representational similarity determine severity of degradation

## Scope and Approach
The meta-prompt will instruct the model to:
- **Detect** surface-level linguistic patterns that correlate with known failure modes
- **Classify** conflicts according to established taxonomies (mutual exclusions, format conflicts, logical contradictions, etc.)
- **Assess** risk levels based on conflict type, quantity, and interaction patterns
- **Report** specific conflicts with exact quoted phrases and actionable feedback

## Acknowledged Limitations
As a prompt-based analysis without access to model internals, this approach:
- Cannot measure true representational similarity or internal superposition
- Uses surface patterns as proxies for deeper conflicts
- Cannot detect all forms of interference that emerge during computation
- Provides heuristic risk assessment, not guarantees of behavior
- Depends on the analyzing model's own capabilities and potential biases

## Value Proposition
Despite these limitations, the meta-prompt provides critical value by:
1. **Preventing known failure patterns** through pre-submission analysis
2. **Educating users** about prompt characteristics that degrade model performance
3. **Reducing iteration cycles** by catching ambiguities before generating corrupted outputs
4. **Documenting specific conflicts** with clear examples from the prompt
5. **Establishing best practices** for prompt construction based on empirical research

## Success Metrics
The meta-prompt succeeds when it:
- Correctly identifies prompts exhibiting "averaged compromise" behavior like the Mercury experiment
- Detects mutual exclusions, format conflicts, and logical contradictions with high accuracy
- Explains why specific instruction combinations will fail
- Provides clear, quoted evidence of conflicts from the analyzed prompt
- Suggests specific modifications to resolve ambiguities

## Research-Driven Design
All detection categories, conflict patterns, and risk assessments are derived from peer-reviewed research on:
- How models represent and process conflicting information (superposition)
- When and why alignment degrades (emergent misalignment, safety guardrails)
- Which conflicts matter most (task sensitivity, knowledge requirements)
- What patterns consistently cause failures (conflict taxonomies)

## Implementation Strategy
The meta-prompt will:
1. Present a systematic checklist of 15+ conflict categories
2. Include critical red flag patterns that almost always cause problems
3. Require specific quotation of conflicting phrases
4. Demand structured output with issue type, location, severity, and impact
5. Provide an analysis summary predicting likely failure modes

This objective acknowledges both the theoretical impossibility of perfect conflict detection via prompt analysis and the practical value of identifying high-risk patterns before they corrupt model outputs.
