# Prompt Conflict Detection Meta-Prompt

Analyze the following prompt for ambiguities, contradictions, and conflicts that would force a language model to produce compromised outputs due to superposition interference (attempting to satisfy incompatible requirements simultaneously).

## SYSTEMATIC DETECTION CHECKLIST:

### 1. MUTUAL EXCLUSIONS
Check for instructions that are logically incompatible:
- "Only X" combined with "Only Y"
- "Exactly N" combined with "Exactly M" (where N â‰  M)
- "Never" combined with "Always" for same action
- "Must be X" combined with "Must be Y" where X and Y are exclusive
- Language exclusivity ("English only" + "French only")
- Format exclusivity ("JSON only" + "Plain text only")
- "Both...and" combined with "either...or" for same items

### 2. FORMAT CONFLICTS
Identify incompatible formatting requirements:
- Structured format (JSON/XML) + "no special characters"
- "Prose form" + "bullet points"
- "Table format" + "narrative paragraph"
- Specific length + conflicting length
- Code format + natural language format simultaneously
- Format + "no formatting"
- Structured data + "natural prose"

### 3. LOGICAL CONTRADICTIONS
Find requirements that cannot coexist:
- Temporal impossibilities (past deadline + future deadline)
- Size constraints (minimum > maximum)
- Brevity + verbosity ("be concise" + "elaborate extensively")
- Precision + vagueness ("exact details" + "general overview only")
- "Complete" + unrealistic constraints
- "Simple" + complex requirements
- Percentages that don't sum correctly

### 4. DOMAIN MIXING
Detect problematic domain combinations:
- Technical specifications + casual language requirements
- Formal constraints + informal modifications
- Mathematical notation + prose narrative
- Objective analysis + subjective opinion simultaneously
- Expert terminology + beginner explanations
- "Be creative" + "Be factual" (competing modes)

### 5. UNCLEAR INTENT
Identify vague or ambiguous instructions:
- Actions without clear purpose
- Vague referents ("analyze this" without antecedent)
- Undefined improvement requests ("make it better")
- Missing context for relative terms
- "Do a good job" without success criteria
- "Use the standard approach" without defining it

### 6. ORDER-DEPENDENT CONFLICTS
Find instructions whose sequence creates ambiguity:
- Later instructions that negate earlier ones
- "But" / "however" / "except" that reverse requirements
- Progressive modifications that conflict
- Multiple "except" clauses that eliminate all options
- "Must" + "optional" for same requirement

### 7. UNDERSPECIFICATION
Identify missing critical information:
- Output format specified but not structure details
- Task requested but success criteria undefined
- "Analyze" without specifying what aspects
- "Improve" without baseline or target metrics
- Length requirements without unit (words/sentences/paragraphs)
- "The usual format" without defining it
- "As we discussed" without prior context

### 8. COMPETING PRIORITIES
Find objectives that aren't clearly prioritized:
- Multiple goals without ranking ("be accurate AND creative AND concise")
- Trade-offs not specified ("maximize X while minimizing Y")
- Quality vs quantity tensions unresolved
- Speed vs accuracy requirements both emphasized

### 9. REFERENCE AMBIGUITY
Detect unclear references:
- Pronouns without clear antecedents ("it", "this", "that")
- Multiple possible referents for same term
- "The above" when multiple things are above
- "As mentioned" without clear mention
- List items referenced ambiguously ("the first one" after multiple lists)
- Passive voice hiding who should do what

### 10. SCOPE CREEP
Identify accumulating requirements that overwhelm:
- Long chains of "Also..." adding new requirements
- Multiple "AND" conditions stacking up
- Feature requests that contradict the core task
- Expanding requirements that make token limits impossible
- "Analyze everything" + word limit

### 11. IMPOSSIBLE CONSTRAINTS
Find requirements that cannot fit together:
- Token/character limits too small for requirements
- "Comprehensive analysis" in 50 words
- "List all" with a small maximum
- Time estimates impossible for task scope
- Precision requirements beyond model capability
- Length too short for requirements (100 words for 20 points)

### 12. ROLE/PERSPECTIVE CONFUSION
Detect mixed viewpoints or voices:
- Switching between "you" and "I" perspectives
- Multiple personas requested simultaneously
- Expert role + beginner explanations
- Objective analysis + personal opinions
- Formal report + casual conversation

### 13. CONDITIONAL CHAOS
Find nested or conflicting conditionals:
- If-then chains that contradict
- Multiple "unless" clauses that conflict
- "Except when" conditions that cover everything
- Circular dependencies ("if A then B, if B then A")

### 14. IMPLICIT ASSUMPTIONS
Identify unstated but required context:
- Technical terms without definitions
- Cultural references assumed universal
- "Obviously" preceding non-obvious points
- Assumed knowledge without verification

### 15. SEQUENCING PROBLEMS
Detect ordering issues that affect output:
- Dependencies out of order (use result before calculating)
- "First" appearing after "second"
- Chronological impossibilities
- Prerequisites mentioned after dependents
- Summary requested before analysis

## CRITICAL RED FLAGS (High Priority):
These patterns almost always cause problems:
1. Double "only": "only X" appears twice with different X
2. Double "exactly": Different exact numbers for same thing
3. "No [X]" + requirement that needs X
4. "Never" + "always" for same action
5. "All" combined with strict limits

## OUTPUT FORMAT:

For each issue found, report:
1. **Issue Type**: [Category from above]
2. **Conflicting Requirements**: Quote exact phrases that conflict
3. **Location**: Where in the prompt this occurs
4. **Severity**:
   - HARD (impossible to reconcile)
   - SOFT (difficult but possible)
5. **Impact**: How this will corrupt the output

## ANALYSIS SUMMARY:
Provide:
- Total conflicts detected: [number]
- Critical issues: [list most severe]
- Predicted output behavior: Will the model likely produce:
  a) Averaged compromise (partially satisfying multiple requirements)
  b) Selective compliance (following some requirements, ignoring others)
  c) Complete failure (unable to generate coherent output)

**Instructions**: Analyze systematically through all 15 categories. Be specific about exact phrases that conflict. Focus on structural/logical conflicts rather than preference differences. If no issues found in a category, skip it in the output.
